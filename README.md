# Football Match Outcome Prediction


### Overview

Is it really possible to predict the results of football matches? During the data challenge organized by Qube Research & Technologies we took on the challenge of predicting the outcome of football matches. Using advanced feature engineering techniques and stacking methods, our model achieved an accuracy of 48.9%.

This intense and innovative afternoon of work earned us second place, with a narrow margin.


### Project Description

This project involves predicting the outcome of football matches using data from over 32 leagues and individual player stats. The core of our work is contained in the provided Jupyter notebook, which details the data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

### Files
